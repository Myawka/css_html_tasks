    <p><b>Domestic cats</b> <i>(Felis catus)</i> are small carnivorous members of the family Felidae â€” the only member of that family that has deigned to join humans in domesticated bliss.</p>
    <p>Cats have lived among humans for thousands of years. They probably started hanging around human grain stores, attracted by mice and other vermin, and eventually spread around the world as sailors brought them aboard ships.</p>
    <p>Today, cats still help humans control vermin and also provide companionship. In the past few centuries, humans have bred some cats to display certain traits, like hairlessness, establishing dozens of cat breeds. With their charming mix of aloofness and goofiness, cats amuse and fascinate humans in equal turns.</p>
