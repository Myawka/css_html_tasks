   <h2>Text about roses.</h2>
   <p><h3>Roses are beautiful flowers that have long been a symbol of love. They belong to the genus <i>Rosa</i>, which exists in both wild and cultivated forms. A wonderful variety of cultivated roses exist today. Flowers of many different colors are available. Some produce an enchanting fragrance to add to their attraction.</h3>
   </p>
   <p>
   <h3>Roses have been admired by humans since ancient times. They are useful plants and ornamental. An aromatic and flavorful oil can be extracted from their petals. The oil has culinary and cosmetic uses. Rose water captures the essence of the flowers in a more dilute form but is still valuable. The fruits of the plants, or rose hips, can be a useful food and also provide an oil.</h3>

   <h2>Types of Roses</h2>
    <p>
    Different classification systems for roses exist. A common one divides the plants into three main categories. Each category is subdivided into smaller groups. The main categories are:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Wild or species roses (flowers with a single layer of petals; includes wild roses and their close but cultivated relatives)</li>
    <li>Old garden roses (cultivated flowers that existed before the creation of the hybrid tea rose in 1867, with the exception of the species roses)</li>
    <li>Modern garden roses (the hybrid tea rose and later creations)</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Rose Colors and Their Symbolic Meanings</h2>
<h3>A rose color can have a different meaning for different people. Often, people like a color simply because it's beautiful. It's fun to look at the traditional meanings of the colors, though.</h3>
